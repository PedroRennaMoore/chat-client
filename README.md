Recently, I worked on a challenging project of a real-time online chat, which I developed from scratch, including the frontend, backend, and WebSocket.

It was an intense and enriching experience as I had to deal with various areas of React and faced several bugs throughout the development. It was a significant challenge, but I was satisfied with the results achieved.

During the development, I learned a lot about the importance of good state management and the need to handle errors in real-time. Additionally, it was an excellent opportunity to solidify my knowledge in backend technologies such as Node.js, database (MySQL), and WebSocket (socket.io).

This project allowed me to grow as a developer and taught me the importance of a well-organized project.

I am always looking for new challenges and projects that allow me to continue learning and evolving as a professional.

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, WebSocket, Node.js, MySQL.

Here you can check all client files(frontend), but you can also check the server: https://github.com/PedroRennaMoore/chat-server, and the websocket: https://github.com/PedroRennaMoore/chat-websocket.

Here are some images of my Project.
